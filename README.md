This project is to help Simon Walters create a pen drive that contains
software ready to install on Raspberry Pi with no internet connection.

The code that I have created is released under a Creative Commons
BY-SA 2.0 licence. In other words you can hack it to make it your own
and I won't chase you for it!

Have fun and keep hacking.
